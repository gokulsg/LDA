The structure of this project is:
1) movies-pp.txt - dataset
2) Latent Dirichlet Allocation.ipynb - implementation of LDA
3) output - This folder contain the output files
            - topic_words_output.txt - 10 most frequent words in topic for alpha = 0.02, beta = 0.1, 20 topics and 500 iterations
            - topic_document_distribution_output.txt - Distribution of topic across documents for alpha = 0.02, beta = 0.1, 20 topics and 500 iterations

            - topic_words_output_topic_10.txt - 5 most frequent words in topic for alpha = 0.02, beta = 0.1, 10 topics and 250 iterations
            - topic_document_distribution_output_topic_10.txt - Distribution of topic across documents for alpha = 0.02, beta = 0.1, 10 topics and 250 iterations

            - topic_words_output_news_data.txt - 5 most frequent words in topic for news dataset - alpha = 0.02, beta = 0.1, 3 topics and 200 iterations
            - topic_document_distribution_output_news_data.txt - Distribution of topic across documents for news dataset - alpha = 0.02, beta = 0.1, 3 topics and 200 iterations

Additional work:
  - I worked on identifying the distribution of topics across the documents
  - Experimented with different hyperparameter values
  - Tried using LDA on 20 newsgroups dataset
